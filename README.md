THIS DEMO CODE: https://naotica2.github.io/server-checker/

Just a basic code that shows the status of a Minecraft server, kinda like Hypixel and all that.

Feel free to edit it or add anything to make it better—just make sure you know what you're doing with the code.

Oh, and don’t forget to join my server too! The IP on the website:

Enjoy!
